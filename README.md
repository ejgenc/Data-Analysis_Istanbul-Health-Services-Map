# An Exercise in Open Data: Mapping Istanbul’s Health Services

## What is this?

This is a short report – like project that aims to reveal some interesting patterns or possible inequalities regarding the distribution of health services in my home city Istanbul. It also serves as a hands-on project where I get to exercise my data manipulation and visualization skills in **Python.**

## Technical Details

**This project is fueled by open data drawn from different sources**

* Data about healthcare service providers comes from **Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality’s Open Data service.**

* The geospatial data that made mapping possible comes from the **OpenStreetMap database.**

**The whole project was done with Python.**

* The data cleaning and analysis part relies on the **Pandas** package. I have done considerable amounts of cleaning and pre-processing to shape the data into a format that was easier to work with.

* Visualizations are created using **Matplotlib** without the help of extra packages like Seaborn. I did this as a challenge to exercise my Matplotlib skills and to learn the package in deeper detail.

* One data visulization was created using **Inkscape** vector graphics editor.

* For geospatial data, I have used the **Geopandas** package which is built on top of Pandas.
